Additional positive phase increases the phase margin, thus, increasing the damping. The lead compensator also generally increases the magnitude of the open-loop frequency response at higher frequencies, thereby, increasing the gain crossover frequency and overall speed of the system. Therefore, the settling time should decrease as a result of the addition of a lead compensator. The general form of the transfer function of a lead compensator is the following.\n",

Since our system is already type 1 (the plant has an integrator) the steady-state error for a step input will be zero for any value of K. Even though the steady-state error is zero, the slow tail on the response can be attributed to the fact the velocity-error constant is too small. This deficiency can be addressed by employing a value of K that is greater than 1, in other words, a value of K that will shift the magnitude plot upward. Through some trial and error, we will somewhat arbitrarily choose K = 10. Running the following code will demonstrate the effect of adding this K."

    "From examination of the above Bode plot, we have increased the system's magnitude at all frequencies and have pushed the gain crossover frequency higher. The effect of these changes are evident in the closed-loop step response shown above. Unfortunately, the addition of the K has also reduced the system's phase margin as evidenced by the increased overshoot in the system's step response. As mentioned previously, the lead compensator will help add damping to the system in order to reduce the overshoot in the step response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the design of our compensator, we will next address the parameter $\\alpha$ which is defined as the ratio between the zero and pole. The larger the separation between the zero and the pole the greater the bump in phase where the maximum amount of phase that can be added with a single pole-zero pair is 90 degrees. The following equation captures the maximum phase added by a lead compensator as a function of $\\alpha$.\n",

    "While our system does not have the form of a standard second-order system, we can use the above relationship as a starting point in our design. As we are required to have overshoot less than 10%, we need our damping ratio $\\zeta$ to be approximately larger than 0.59 and thus need a phase margin greater than about 59 degrees. Since our current phase margin (with the addition of K) is approximately 10.4 degrees, an additional 50 degrees of phase bump from the lead compensator should be sufficient. Since it is known that the lead compensator will further increase the magnitude of the frequency response, we will need to add more than 50 degrees of phase lead to account for the fact that the gain crossover frequency will increase to a point where the system has more phase lag. We will somewhat arbitrarily add 5 degrees and aim for a total bump in phase of 50+5 = 55 degrees.\n",

    "\n",
    "Examining the Bode plot shown above, the magnitude of the uncompensated system equals -10 dB at approximately 6.1 rad/sec. Therefore, the addition of our lead compensator will move the gain crossover frequency from 3.49 rad/sec to approximately 6.1 rad/sec. Using this information, we can then calculate a value of T from the following in order to center the maximum bump in phase at the new gain crossover frequency in order to maximize the system's resulting phase margin.\n",

This process becomes more difficult if we have a higher-order system or zeros. With a higher-order system, one approach is to place the higher-order poles 5-10 times farther to the left in the complex plane than the dominant poles, thereby leading them to have negligible contribution to the transient response. The effect of zeros is more difficult to address using a pole-placement approach to control. Another limitation of this pole-placement approach is that it doesn't explicitly take into account other factors like the amount of required control effort."

This type of control technique optimally balances the system error and the control effort based on a cost that the designer specifies that defines the relative importance of minimizing errors and minimimizing control effort. In the case of the regulator problem, it is assumed that the reference is zero. Therefore, in this case the magnitude of the error is equal to the magnitude of the state. To use this LQR method, we need to define two parameters: the state-cost weighted matrix (Q) and the control weighted matrix (R). For simplicity, we will choose the control weighted matrix equal to 1 (R=1), and the state-cost matrix (Q) equal to pC'C. Employing the vector C from the output equation means that we will only consider those states in the output in defining our cost. In this case,  $\\theta$ is the only state variable in the output. The weighting factor (p) will be varied in order to modify the step response. In this case, R is a scalar since we have a single input system."
